# 4DOF_Robotic_Arm_In_Gazebo_With_Moveit2

# Abstract

A 4 degree-of-freedom robotic arm powered by ROS2 and controlled by Moveit2 and Gazebo.
This package contains a URDF model of a 4 DOF robotic arm equipped with a claw for gripping.

# Requirements
The ROS packages of diff_drive_controller,camera_controller ,joint_state_controller and joint_pose_trajectory_controller are required.

For example, you can install these requirements on  Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS by the following command:<br>
   
    sudo apt install ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs

# Direct usage
* Clone this repository into a ROS catkin workspace
* Build and source the workspace
* To view this robot model on RViz: $ ros2 launch my_robot_description display.launch.xml
* To launch this package in test Gazebo world and Rviz: $ ros2 launch my_robot_bringup my_robot_gazebo.launch.xml

  

# Gazebo Simulation
Control the robot inside Gazebo and view what it sees in RViz using the following launch file:

    ros2 launch my_robot_bringup my_robot_gazebo.launch.xml

This will launch the default test world **test_world.world**.

To actuate the arm use the following command:

    ros2 topic pub -1 /set_joint_trajectory trajectory_msgs/msg/JointTrajectory '{header:{frame_id: base_footprint}, joint_names: [arm_base_forearm_joint, forearm_hand_joint],points: [ {positions: {0.3, 0.4}} ]}'

Change positions as required.

To move the mobile base use the following command:

    ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.2}}"

Set desired velocity in the x-axis.

# RViz
View just the robot in RViz.

ros2 launch my_robot_description display.launch.xml
